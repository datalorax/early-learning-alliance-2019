# Early Learning Alliance Project
This project is focused on comparing school districts in Lane county in terms of
performance on the statewide kindergarten assessment. The data used are all
publicly available and, although the focus here is on Lane county, similar
analyses could be conducted for any county in the state.

The data are available [here](https://www.oregon.gov/ode/educator-resources/assessment/Pages/Kindergarten-Assessment.aspx) 
and are not in a particularly friendly format. The structure also varies by
year. See the `clean-names` and `data-prep` scripts for getting the data into a
more workable format.
